                <h2>My Principles on UI Design</h2>
                <p>I've seen enough counterexamples of how software can be designed poorly. Here are some principles
                    that I strive to follow when designing a UI:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Clear directions.</b> A first-time user must be able to understand the next steps without
                        time-consuming searching or random button-clicking.</li>
                    <li><b>Predictable behavior.</b> The application should do exactly what the user instructed it to
                        do, no more no less. Absolutely no auto-completing without their knowledge or approval.</li>
                    <li><b>Reversible actions.</b> Users should be able to undo their actions. No more next button
                        without a back button. No more accidental deletion without a way to restore the data.</li>
                    <li><b>Transparent Errors.</b> Users should be able to understand why an error occurred, and how to
                        fix it. No more "Something went wrong" or "Please try again later".</li>
                    <li><b>Lightweight.</b> Things should not feel heavy. The UI should be as light as possible, and the
                        user should be able to navigate through the UI with ease.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Things I Enjoy</h2>
                <p>Activities and interests that bring me joy and help me grow:</p>

                <h3>Language Learning</h3>
                <p>I love exploring new languages and cultures. There's something fascinating about how different
                    languages structure thought and express ideas. Each language opens up new ways of seeing the world.
                </p>

                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>Books are my gateway to different worlds, ideas, and perspectives. I'm particularly drawn to
                    detective and mystery novels for their clever puzzles and storytelling, personal development books
                    that help me grow, and technology books that keep me informed about the latest innovations and
                    trends.</p>

                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <p>Exploring new places helps me understand different cultures and ways of life. I find that travel
                    broadens my perspective and often provides fresh insights that I can bring back to my work and
                    relationships.</p>

                <h3>Fitness</h3>
                <p>I enjoy the discipline and progress that comes with regular exercise. There's something deeply
                    satisfying about building strength, improving my physique, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The
                    gym is my space for both physical and mental growth.</p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>I'm passionate about rock and metal music, drawn to their energy and complexity. I also love
                    classical piano music, especially Chopin and Rachmaninoff - their emotional depth and musical
                    complexity really resonate with me. Among my musical experiences is participating in an Eastern
                    Orthodox choir at a Russian church, singing in Slavonic - an experience that cultivated my
                    appreciation for traditional choral music and cultural expression.</p>

                <h2>Hopes and Dreams</h2>
                <p>Personal growth is a journey that never ends. Here are some areas where I hope to improve and grow:
                </p>

                <h3>Writer</h3>
                <p>I want to develop my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and engagingly. Whether it's
                    technical documentation, personal reflections, or creative writing, I believe good writing has the
                    power to connect people and share knowledge effectively.</p>

                <h3>Photographer</h3>
                <p>I'm drawn to capturing moments that tell stories and evoke emotions. Photography teaches me to see
                    the world differently - to notice light, composition, and the beauty in everyday moments. I hope to
                    develop both technical skills and artistic vision.</p>

                <h3>Designer</h3>
                <p>Good design is invisible yet essential. I want to deepen my understanding of user experience, visual
                    design, and the principles that make interfaces both beautiful and functional. Design thinking
                    extends beyond screens to how we solve problems and create meaningful experiences.</p>

                <h3>Partner</h3>
                <p>Relationships require continuous learning and growth. I want to become more empathetic,
                    communicative, and supportive in my personal relationships. Being a good partner means showing up,
                    listening deeply, and creating space for others to flourish.</p>
