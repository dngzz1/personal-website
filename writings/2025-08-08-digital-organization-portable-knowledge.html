                    <p>I recently watched Zach Highley's video <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMJSkU3rVNg&ab_channel=ZachHighley" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">"How I Organized My Entire Life Using Just Apple Notes,"</a>
                        and it sparked some reflection on the eternal quest for the perfect organizational system. His
                        approach—consolidating everything into a single, native application—has undeniable merit.
                        There's something refreshingly honest about abandoning the complexity of multiple interconnected
                        systems and embracing simplicity.</p>

                    <p>Highley's central thesis resonates: the proliferation of productivity apps like Notion, Evernote,
                        Obsidian, and countless others often creates more friction than it resolves. The constant
                        syncing, the feature creep, the cognitive overhead of remembering which information lives
                        where—these are genuine problems that plague many digital knowledge workers. His solution of
                        radical simplification through Apple Notes offers an elegant escape from this complexity.</p>

                    <p>Yet as I considered his approach, I found myself appreciating a different dimension of the
                        problem entirely: portability. While Apple Notes excels within the Apple ecosystem, it
                        represents a form of digital dependency that gives me pause. My mind drifted to the knowledge
                        base I'm building here—written in HTML and markdown, stored as plain text files, completely
                        platform-agnostic and eternally accessible.</p>

                    <p>There's something deeply satisfying about creating knowledge in formats that will outlive any
                        particular company, operating system, or technological paradigm. HTML has been with us for over
                        three decades, and markdown's simplicity ensures its longevity. These aren't just storage
                        formats; they're acts of digital preservation, insurance policies against the inevitable
                        obsolescence of proprietary systems.</p>

                    <p>This isn't to diminish Highley's approach—his system clearly works for him, and the reduction of
                        complexity is genuinely valuable. But it highlights a fundamental tension in digital
                        organization: the trade-off between convenience and control, between integration and
                        independence. Apple Notes offers seamless synchronization and native optimization, while
                        portable formats offer permanence and platform freedom.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the ideal lies not in choosing sides, but in conscious intentionality about what we
                        optimize for. For ephemeral notes and quick captures, the convenience of native apps makes
                        perfect sense. For knowledge we intend to preserve and build upon over decades, the durability
                        of open formats becomes compelling. The key is recognizing which type of information we're
                        working with and choosing our tools accordingly.</p>

                    <p>In watching someone else's organizational journey, I've gained clarity on my own preferences: I
                        choose portability over convenience, longevity over integration. It's a trade-off, certainly,
                        but one that aligns with my values of digital self-sufficiency and long-term thinking. Sometimes
                        the best system isn't the most efficient one, but the one that will still be working twenty
                        years from now.</p>
