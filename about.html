                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>For the first 25 years of my life, I believed Mathematics was my destiny. As a child, I was already
                    fascinated by abstract mathematical concepts, and would spend hours playing with my father's
                    calculator, trying to figure out how it worked.</p>
                <p>Throughout secondary school, I was the go-to person for Mathematics and Physics. I was a reserved
                    student, quietly producing quality work and helping my classmates whenever they needed help. I
                    occasionally spent my lunch breaks entering random classrooms and populating their whiteboards with
                    elaborate equations.</p>
                <p>Studying Mathematics at Cambridge University felt like a natural fit. Homework felt more like a hobby
                    rather than a chore. Exams felt more like an adventure rather than a burden. I enjoyed the
                    intellectual environment and had high hopes for a career in academia.</p>
                <p>I received a scholarship to study a PhD at the University of Bath, where I decided to major in
                    Analysis and Probability. Alongside research, I also tutored first- and second-year undergraduates
                    in groups of 10-20 students.</p>
                <p>Soon I realized that I enjoyed teaching far more than research. I struggled to find a topic I truly
                    wanted to dedicate to for the next three years, and spent my time hopping from one topic to another.
                    On the other hand, the immediate impact of my teaching brought me a far more positive experience
                    than my meandering research journey. I discovered that I could explain abstract mathematics concepts
                    in vivid metaphors and stories, and students from other classes flocked to my tutorials.</p>
                <p>I was known for my unconventional teaching methods and catering to Gen Z's needs. For example, one
                    day the weather was sunny, and instead of teaching the students in a dingy classroom, I took them
                    out to the university's amphitheatre by the lake, where I taught eigenvectors on a portable
                    whiteboard.</p>
                <p>The students reciprocated positively, and I was able to build a strong rapport with them. One class
                    even wrote me a thank you card together with a bottle of gin. I was nominated for the University's
                    Teaching Excellence Award, and was invited to a dinner gala with other excellent teachers.</p>
                <p>At this point, it was clear that the research was a distraction rather than a goal. The choice was
                    not hard to make. One day, I broke the news to my supervisors that I'd like to pursue teaching
                    instead. While long-term teaching opportunities such as Teaching Fellows exist within academia,
                    without contributing to research, the career path was suboptimal. Instead, I decided to enroll in a
                    PGCE program to become a qualified Mathematics secondary school teacher.</p>
                <p>I successfully received an offer from Bath Spa University for a funded position as a Mathematics
                    teacher trainee. The interview process was surprisingly pleasant. I was tasked to pick any topic to
                    teach to a panel of teachers, and I chose to play a version of Wordle with them before it was
                    well-known, and explained to them how this game could be used to teach probability.</p>
                <p>However, things had an unexpected turn. My Director of Studies at Magdalene College, University of
                    Cambridge offered me a position to teach as a Mathematics supervisor, as the previous supervisor had
                    decided to retire. As the opportunity was too good to pass up, I took up the position, with the
                    intention to reapplying to a PGCE the year after.</p>
                <p>And so I relocated back to Cambridge, inheriting the batch of students from the previous supervisor.
                    The format was slightly different compared to the lecture-based style lessons at Bath, as Cambridge
                    offers one-on-one or one-on-two classes, so I adapted my teaching style to be more tailored and
                    interactive. This was quite a relaxing job, as I had full autonomy and plenty of time to myself
                    outside of work.</p>
                <p>Then COVID-19 hit. We moved all our classes online, and I continued teaching my students via Zoom.
                    Throughout the pandemic, I developed my own set of materials, wrote my own collection of practice
                    questions, and laid them out neatly in LaTex format. It was also then that I started a personal
                    website for my students to access my materials.</p>
                <p>Due to the situation, I was unable to go ahead with my original plan I had with the PGCE. Schools
                    enforced strict social distancing rules and classroom life was all the more disrupted. I decided to
                    continue teaching as a supervisor at Cambridge, picking up more subjects and students from other
                    colleges. This was a welcomed move, because there is a chronic shortage of supervisors at Cambridge,
                    and Directors of Studies from various colleges were more than happy to have me.</p>
                <p>It was at this time that I also stepped onto the interviewing panel for college admissions for
                    Downing College. I wrote interview questions of escalating difficulty, and interviewed the
                    candidates via Zoom. What struck me was the variance of aptitude of the candidates. Some of the
                    candidates were so frightened by the whole process that they could barely articulate coherent
                    responses. On the other hand, some candidates breezed through our questions. One even outsmarted us
                    by providing a solution so clever that we had to sit down and work it out after the interview.</p>
                <p>Being a supervisor and interviewer came with exceptional privileges. I had dining rights at Downing
                    College, where I could sit at the high table alongside with other professors, exchange intellectual
                    ideas, all the while enjoying unlimited quantities of freshly prepared salads, main courses and
                    puddings. After the satisfying meal, I would amble to the adjacent common room, prepare myself a cup
                    of macchiato with their barista-grade coffee machine, sink into their deluxe sofas and read
                    Mathematics.</p>
                <p>In my third year as a supervisor, my younger brother, who majored in Chemistry at university,
                    transitioned into software in Hong Kong. He enjoyed the nature of the job, where technology is
                    ever-evolving and developers have to constantly learn to keep up with the latest trends. Inspired by
                    the prospects, I decided to seriously consider breaking into this field rather than my original plan
                    of teaching. Even though I have been picking up new subjects to teach, the repetitive nature of
                    teaching was starting to wear on me. </p>
                <p>I began exploring various programming languages. This was surprisingly enjoyable, and I found myself
                    gravitating towards languages with compile-time type checking. I started my journey from Java, and
                    while this language has its own problematic quirks, it provided a solid foundation for my
                    understanding of computer science. I played around with Java for a while, using it to tackle
                    brainteasers like Advent of Code, then moved onto other languages such as Rust and Haskell, which I
                    found to be more thoughtfully designed.</p>
                <p>Early summer 2022, I announced that I would be stepping down from my position at Cambridge, and that
                    I would be looking to transition into software development. While my Director of Studies was sad to
                    see me go, she was supportive, and I was able to leave with a clean conscience.</p>
                <p>I applied for a few Java positions, and did get quite some attractive offers, but in an unexpected
                    turn of events, I also ended up applying to Midsummer Energy as a Frontend Developer, where
                    JavaScript was the main language. They were kind enough to offer me on-the-job training where I
                    could learn the ropes of Frontend Development. While this was not what I had initially planned as I
                    had always had Java in mind, I accepted the offer, as I was moved by the sincerity of the founder's
                    genuine enthusiasm and the company's mission to provide clean energy to the UK.</p>
                <p>Midsummer Energy is not exactly where you'd expect a software company to be located in. It's located
                    in a dilapidated industrial estate, sandwiched between a cement factory and wholesale paint
                    supplier. The company itself is attached to a warehouse of solar panels, where forklifts constantly
                    ferry boxes of solar equipment day in and day out.</p>
                <p>Indeed, Midsummer Energy really isn't marketed as a software company. It's an energy company that
                    happens to have a founder passionate about coding, and thus formed a small software team. Andy began
                    the company on a narrowboat in 2005, where he lived his humble life, and sold solar panels to his
                    neighbors. As his client base got larger, he pieced together a website to help manage his sales.
                    Fast forward 15+ years, the company has grown to a team of 50+ people, with 2 locations in the UK
                    and
                    1 in the Republic of Ireland. </p>
                <p>When I joined the software team, I was one of four developers, plus Andy himself, who from time to
                    time contributed to the codebase. I was tasked to build a 3D studio for the company's upcoming
                    tradeshow. Nobody had any experience with 3D designs, and I had to teach myself how to use THREE.js.
                    I spent a while toying around with pet projects, and successfully built a prototype version for
                    rendering shapes of houses and trees, from then which users can place panels and model the shadow
                    for the solar grid system.</p>
                <p>Despite starting small, the software team quickly ballooned. The war with Ukraine led to electricity
                    prices skyrocketing, and the demand for solar panels surged in response. With the solid stream of
                    income, the company was able to hire more developers, and the software team grew to 10+ people, and
                    the office nearly ran out of desk space.</p>
                <p>The company culture at Midsummer was unreal. Personally I'm not a big fan of the British afterwork
                    culture at a typical corporate office, which mostly involves alcohol and late night outs. However,
                    at Midsummer, this was not obligatory, and I made great friends with my colleagues. With one group
                    of colleagues, I toured Cambridge's fine dining scene, including two which were about to get one
                    Michelin star. We had free vegetable bags every week from a local farm, where I tried my hands at
                    cooking exotic purple legumes. We also had bring-a-dog day, where I got to cuddle with various
                    canines my colleagues had brought along to the office.</p>
                <p>My contribution to the company quickly got recognition, and after just two years, I was promoted to
                    Frontend Lead. I led the makeover of the company's Heatpunk website, coordinating with the design
                    team to create a sleek and modern interface. I also coordinated with the marketing team to create a
                    new landing page for the company's Heatpunk product, which was a success.</p>
                <p>Sadly, I had to leave the company in 2025, as I had to move back to Hong Kong to be with my family. I
                    left on good terms, packed my bags and moved back to my hometown. By a stroke of luck, a former
                    Midsummer employee saw my LinkedIn post, and connected me with OpenSolar, a company with a very
                    similar business model but operates worldwide. I'm now working as a Senior Software Developer
                    remotely, helping them with their 3.0 launch in September 2025.</p>
